# SPECULA Method Foundation

SPECULA is a speculative governance framework designed to help organizations
deliberately choose which futures they want to make more likely.

It prioritizes:
- identity before strategy
- limits as design
- ethics before optimization
- questions over answers

SPECULA is not a branding toolkit, an innovation sprint, or a prediction engine.

It must not be used for manipulation, deception, or extractive short-termism.
Failure in those contexts is intentional.
