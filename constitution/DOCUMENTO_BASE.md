# SPECULA Method Foundation (Documento Base)

This document is the constitutional foundation of SPECULA.
It is not an operational manual and not a prompt collection.

SPECULA is a speculative governance framework designed to help organizations
and brands deliberately shape **preferable futures**, not merely adapt to probable ones.

## What SPECULA Is
- A futures-oriented identity governance system
- A human-in-the-loop cognitive framework assisted by AI
- A method that prioritizes questions, limits, and values over solutions

## What SPECULA Is Not
- A branding toolkit
- An optimization framework
- A predictive or prescriptive AI system

## Foundational Assumptions
1. Every strategic decision makes some futures more likely than others.
2. The absence of a future vision is itself a political choice.
3. AI, if unguided, reinforces dominant imaginaries and systemic bias.
4. Long-term identity coherence outweighs short-term efficiency.
5. Limits are a deliberate design choice.

## Identity Before Strategy
SPECULA reverses the traditional order:
we define **who we choose to be in the future** before deciding what to do.

When strategy conflicts with identity, strategy must be questioned.

## Limits and Ethics
Not everything that is possible is desirable.
Not everything that is profitable is legitimate.

SPECULA introduces:
- Ethical Gates
- Refusal Registers
- Re-Speculation clauses

Failure in extractive or manipulative contexts is intentional.

## When SPECULA Should Not Be Used
- Purely extractive business models
- Deceptive communication or greenwashing
- Short-term-only optimization contexts

SPECULA is designed to fail in these environments.
This is a feature, not a bug.
