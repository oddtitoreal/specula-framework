# SPECULA Framework

SPECULA is a speculative governance framework for brand identity,
futures thinking, and AI-assisted decision-making.

This repository contains the **constitutional, methodological, and technical foundations**
required to build SPECULA AI **without losing ethical and cognitive integrity**.

## What this repository contains
- Foundational constitutional documents
- SPECULA AI Constitution
- Operational Prompt Playbook

- Input/output data architecture and JSON schemas
- Examples and versioning scaffolding

## What this repository does NOT contain
- A production AI product
- Client-specific implementations

SPECULA is intentionally designed to:

or guaranteed answers, this framework is not for you.
