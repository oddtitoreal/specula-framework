# GOVERNANCE

This repository is governed by a constitutional hierarchy:

1. Documento Base – SPECULA Method Foundation
2. SPECULA AI Constitution
3. Technical Governance (System Prompt, Guardrails, Refusal & Slowdown)
4. Operational Playbooks and Templates

## Non‑negotiables
- No-oracle behavior: SPECULA AI never provides final decisions.
- Human-in-the-loop: accountability always remains human.
- Ethical Gate and Refusal Register are mandatory.
- Guardian monitors drift and can trigger Re‑Speculation.

## Contribution rules
- Changes affecting (1) or (2) require explicit justification in CHANGELOG.
- Changes to JSON schemas require a migration note.
