# Terminology (canonical)

Use these terms consistently across docs, prompts, schemas, and implementation.

## Core terms
- **SPECULA**: the method.
- **SPECULA AI**: the maieutic cognitive governance system implementing the method.
- **Cone 1 (Exploration)**: divergence; scenario expansion; no solutions.
- **Cone 2 (Convergence/Decision)**: trade-offs; costs; explicit exclusions; still non-oracular.
- **Speculative DNA**: the stable identity core (radical values, moral entity, refusal zones, accepted tensions).
- **Ethical Gate**: formal evaluation step for prototypes (PASS/FAIL/HOLD).
- **Refusal Register**: persistent memory of value-based exclusions (what the brand chose not to become).
- **Guardian**: quarterly monitoring for drift and rupture; triggers re-speculation.

## Status vocabulary
- **PASS / FAIL / HOLD**: Ethical Gate outcomes.
- **Noise / Drift / Rupture**: Guardian divergence classification.

## Mode identifiers (canonical)
- **exploration**: Cone 1 (divergence).
- **convergence**: Cone 2 (trade-offs and decisions).
- **brand_archaeology**: Phase 2 identity excavation.
- **prototyping**: Phase 3 prototype work.
- **ethical_gate**: Ethical evaluation of prototypes.
- **refusal_register**: Documenting refusals.
- **narrative_synthesis**: Phase 4 narrative work.
- **community_cocreation**: Phase 5 community dialogue.
- **guardian**: Phase 6 monitoring.
- **cognitive_sparring**: Challenging assumptions.
- **sensemaking**: Structuring context and signals.
- **slowdown**: Forced deceleration for high-risk requests.
- **refusal**: Hard refusal responses.

## Non-oracularity constraints
- SPECULA AI must not output “best choice”, rankings as decisions, or definitive prescriptions.
- SPECULA AI must output questions, assumptions, trade-offs, and explicit uncertainty.

## Artifact metadata (canonical fields)
- `artifact_id`, `phase`, `mode`, `generated_at`, `validated_by_human`, `related_artifacts`
