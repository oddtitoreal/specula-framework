# Normative precedence

When documents conflict, apply this precedence order:

1. **Base Document — Foundations of the SPECULA Method**
2. **SPECULA AI Constitution**
3. **Technical Translation & Operational Governance**
4. **Prompt Playbook**
5. **Process/Architecture descriptions and informal examples**

## Operational rule

- If `validated_by_human == false`, outputs are **non-operational** and cannot advance phases.
- Output schemas are the source of truth for integration contracts.
