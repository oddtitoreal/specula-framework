# Specula Method v2.3

## Executive Summary

Specula is a method of **Strategic Foresight Branding**—a discipline that uses futures as tools to build living, adaptive brand identities oriented toward preferable scenarios. It emerges at the intersection of speculative design, brand strategy, and generative artificial intelligence, with a simple goal: helping organizations and teams imagine possible worlds and transform those visions into decisions, prototypes, and operational narratives.

This document is the operational architecture of the method. It translates the speculative manifesto into a concrete path made of phases, roles, tools, and metrics. Where the manifesto answers “why,” this document addresses “how”: how to design a speculative identity, how to govern the use of AI, how to measure impact, and how to build, over time, an ecosystem of practices, community, and measurable returns.

The process unfolds across six major movements: generating future scenarios; exploring the deep DNA of the brand; prototyping possible roles and identities; distilling a coherent narrative; co-creating with communities; and finally supporting long-term evolution through a continuous monitoring and realignment device. Artificial intelligence is not a “production accelerator,” but a partner for divergence: it is used to surface weak signals, outliers, uncomfortable hypotheses, and combinations humans tend to ignore—not to speed up what teams already do.

Each phase is designed to produce tangible outputs: scenario maps, speculative identity canvases, brand prototypes across different futures, adaptive storylines, AI governance guidelines, and impact dashboards. The method integrates an explicit Ethical Gate that filters prototypes against the brand’s radical values and produces a true “refusal register”: what gets discarded becomes part of identity, not a simple mistake.

To support the journey, Specula introduces a hybrid measurement framework that pairs classic economic metrics (growth, time-to-market, efficiency) with indicators of cultural, relational, and ethical impact. The method also defines clear engagement models—Audit, Full Journey, Guardian—with timeboxes, client effort levels, and transparent investment ranges.

Specula is conceived not only as a service, but as an open infrastructure: the ethical layer of the method is shareable and documentable, while AI tools and operational protocols remain proprietary. Around this core, a community of practice, an alumni network, and pathways for academic validation can emerge—aimed at making speculative branding a shared discipline rather than a rhetorical trick.

## 1. Introduction — From Manifesto to Method

In recent years, branding has begun to reveal its structural limits: generic purpose statements, campaigns chasing ephemeral trends, identities consumed at the speed of feeds. The problem is not only communicative; it is first and foremost imaginative. Many brands keep describing the present while their audiences are already elsewhere—projected, consciously or not, into desired, feared, and ambivalent futures.

Specula exists to work precisely on this gap. The starting question is no longer “How do we position in today’s market?” but “Which futures do we want to help make possible?” From there, the work proceeds backwards, designing identities, products, services, and AI agents that can operate in those futures without losing deep coherence.

The architecture described here is designed to be:

* **Speculative**: it begins from multiple scenarios, not a single linear forecast.
* **AI-assisted**: it uses generative models to expand the field of possibility, not to replace human judgment.
* **Value-anchored**: it structurally integrates an explicit ethical DNA and a refusal policy.
* **Measurable**: it includes impact indicators and review mechanisms from the start.
* **Evolutive**: it culminates in a continuous device (Specula Guardian) that monitors gaps between imagined futures and emerging reality.

In this sense, the Specula Method is simultaneously an identity design process, a blueprint for responsible AI adoption, and a lens for rethinking the role of brands within the social, economic, and environmental systems they inhabit.

## 2. AI Governance in the Specula Method

Artificial intelligence is present across all phases of the method, sometimes configured with higher divergence parameters (higher temperatures) to generate unexpected combinations and challenge consolidated mental models, but always under clear governance. AI never “decides”; people define problems, constraints, radical values, and acceptance criteria. AI’s role is to amplify complexity and act as a maieutic partner.

### 2.1 Modes of Use

Within the Specula Method, we distinguish at least four modes of GenAI use:

1. **Signal analysis**: NLP models and data mining tools read large volumes of content (trend reports, articles, social media, papers, stakeholder conversations) to surface patterns, outliers, contradictions, and weak signals.
2. **Scenario generation**: language and visual models build plausible and preferable future scenarios by combining technological, cultural, economic, and regulatory drivers.
3. **Conversation facilitation**: conversational agents designed as maieutic sparring partners that do not provide answers but ask questions and help teams surface assumptions, fears, desires, and conflicts.
4. **Synthesis and realignment**: clustering, summarization, and rewriting tools transform raw material (workshop notes, transcripts, research decks) into coherent narratives, completed canvases, and operational guidelines.

Across these functions, AI acts as a lens that multiplies perspectives and disrupts the inertia of linear thinking. The Specula team’s job is to design prompts, contexts, and policies that enable AI to function this way.

### 2.2 Principles for Responsible Use

AI governance in the Specula Method is based on non-negotiable principles:

* **Mandatory human-in-the-loop**: no strategic decision—positioning, values, products, or political stances—can be delegated to AI. Every output is discussed in a human setting with explicit responsibility.
* **Double validation**: AI-generated insights are always reviewed by at least two senior people, ideally with different backgrounds (strategy, research, ethics, design).
* **Bias audits**: at the start of each project, the quality and provenance of the data are discussed; throughout the work, outputs are monitored for distortions (group exclusion, stereotypes, normalization of controversial practices).
* **Transparency with the client**: it is always clear when content was generated, co-generated, or merely synthesized by AI. Technology use is never concealed; it is part of the process.

### 2.3 Recognized Limitations

The method explicitly acknowledges structural limitations of AI:

* it tends to replicate biases present in historical data and dominant imaginaries;
* it struggles to capture local cultural nuance and embodied dimensions of experience;
* it often confuses “plausible” with “preferable,” producing coherent but ethically questionable scenarios;
* it has no intrinsic understanding of declared values without designed constraints.

For these reasons, governance layers, explicit radical values, and the Ethical Gate are not optional add-ons; they are integral to the Specula Method.

## 3. The Phases of the Specula Method

The process is organized into six primary phases, with an intermediate step dedicated to competitive futures mapping. Some phases are cyclical and may be reactivated during Guardian collaboration.

### 3.1 Phase 1 — Scenario Generation

The first phase opens the field. It does not begin from a solution to optimize, but from a range of possible and desirable futures. This is the phase of controlled divergence.

Through desk research, interviews, exploratory sessions, and AI use to detect weak signals and unusual correlations, scenarios are built by combining cultural, technological, economic, regulatory, and environmental drivers. The implicit model is the “double cone”: first widening through exploration, then narrowing.

A key part of this phase is allowing AI to generate imperfect, even uncomfortable scenarios: futures where the brand no longer exists, where its values are co-opted by others, or where the context renders its current value proposition irrelevant. These “negative” scenarios are not meant to scare, but to clarify what truly matters and what the brand is unwilling to compromise.

### 3.2 Phase 1.5 — Competitive Futures Mapping

Before moving into brand archaeology, the method introduces an intermediate step: observing what others are doing—or might do.

Competitive Futures Mapping analyzes competitors’ speculative trajectories: not only current campaigns, but R&D investments, partnerships, emerging language, and the narrative territories they are occupying. AI supports the analysis by aggregating dispersed data and suggesting hypotheses for future positioning.

The result is a map that places sector players along dimensions such as innovation radicality, ethical depth, technological intensity, and openness to co-creation. What matters most, however, are not existing clusters but the “holes” between them: the white spaces—the futures no one credibly occupies yet.

This map guides the next phase, preventing the brand from imagining already-saturated futures and helping it find authentic differentiation trajectories.

### 3.3 Phase 2 — Brand Archaeology

Once the future landscape is opened, the work returns to the present to excavate. Brand archaeology aims to surface what can—and must—remain stable across multiple scenarios: radical values, worldview, forms of care, and non-negotiable boundaries.

Here the Speculative Identity Model comes into play: a canvas working across six intertwined dimensions—radical values, persona/entity, agency, speculative interactions, preferable horizons, and alternative tools/metrics. The work is hybrid: on the one hand conversations with the team; on the other AI-assisted analysis of existing traces (communications, past decisions, conflicts, compromises, product stories).

The goal is not to build an ideal portrait but to recognize tensions and contradictions: values declared but not practiced, virtuous behaviors never narrated, necessary compromises kept implicit. This phase also defines the accepted biases of the brand’s AI identity: declared inclinations such as preference for regenerative approaches, mutualistic practices, and public stances on rights or climate justice.

The outcome is a foundational asset: the brand’s speculative DNA, which will guide prototyping and serve as the evaluation criterion in the Ethical Gate.

### 3.4 Phase 3 — Future Prototyping and Ethical Gate

Phase three unfolds in the space between scenario and identity. The brand is tested across different futures: what does it become? What role does it play? Which product/service systems does it activate? What kinds of AI agents would embody its will?

Prototyping happens through speculative design exercises, storytelling, service storyboards, narrative interfaces, and conversational experiences. AI is used to generate variants, stress-test hypotheses, and create coherent worlds around the brand—not just campaigns.

In parallel, the **Resilience Protocol** is designed: a set of stress-test scenarios. Three are relatively “canonical” (recession, regulatory revolution, technological discontinuity). A fourth is always added: the **Wild Card**—a plausible black swan that cannot be linearly modeled, generated by combining seemingly unrelated drivers.

Each identity prototype is tested against these four scenarios—not to find a perfect concept, but to understand what holds, what breaks, and what must be rethought.

At this point the **Ethical Gate** is activated. It is a formal step, not a diffuse sensibility. For each prototype, a few clear questions are answered:

* Does this scenario violate one or more declared radical values?
* Does it introduce manipulative, extractive, or exclusionary practices the brand does not want to legitimize?
* Does it create technological, social, or environmental dependencies we consider unacceptable, even if profitable?

If the answer is yes, the prototype is discarded or deeply redesigned. Crucially, it is also recorded. This produces a **Refusal Register**—an archive of deliberately non-pursued possibilities. Over time, it becomes a critical part of identity: it captures not only what the brand is, but what it has chosen not to become.

### 3.5 Phase 4 — Narrative Synthesis

After passing through the Ethical Gate, what remains is a set of elements: future roles, design principles, AI policies, stories, phrases, images, and service patterns. Narrative synthesis turns this constellation into a coherent story system able to live across multiple time horizons.

Rather than writing a campaign “big idea,” the method builds adaptive narratives: arcs that can be modulated depending on which scenario unfolds, while keeping the core recognizable. AI helps explore registers, voices, formats, and audiences, but humans decide which combinations truly respect the DNA surfaced in Phase 2 and the exclusions in the Refusal Register.

Narrative synthesis produces three levels of output:

* a **meta-narrative** explaining which future the brand is trying to make more probable;
* a set of **operational storylines** for products, services, experiences, and AI agents;
* a corpus of **dynamic guidelines** defining what it concretely means to remain coherent with one’s preferable future in changing contexts.

These outputs feed both external communications and internal processes: onboarding, investment decisions, and innovation priorities.

### 3.6 Phase 5 — Co-Creation and Community Governance

In Phase five, the brand leaves the speculative atelier and exposes itself to confrontation. The preferable-future hypothesis becomes material for dialogue with communities: customers, partners, suppliers, local territories, activists, and those already living the consequences of the futures being discussed.

AI plays a delicate role here: it is not a neutral moderator, but a mediator designed to amplify meaningful divergences without turning them into destructive polarization. It can aggregate thousands of contributions, surface emerging patterns, and identify minority fragments carrying important claims that are easily crushed by majorities.

Co-creation governance includes synchronous moments (workshops, futuring rooms, participatory prototyping) and asynchronous ones (platforms, surveys, dedicated conversational agents). Each listening cycle produces insights that can reinforce or challenge parts of the speculative identity. The rule is explicit: the community can help change many things, but not the radical values and the base ethical perimeter.

At the end of this phase, the speculative identity is no longer just a consultancy artifact; it is a negotiated position between brand and community, with disagreements declared rather than hidden.

### 3.7 Phase 6 — Activation and Specula Guardian

The final phase translates the work into a concrete roadmap: projects, prototypes, releases, experiments, investments. It determines what to activate in the first twelve months and what to postpone; which AI systems to build or integrate; which touchpoints to redesign; which metrics to monitor.

From the start, the method includes the option for long-term accompaniment: **Specula Guardian**. It is not merely a retainer; it is a pact to monitor the gap between imagined future and emerging reality and to intervene when that gap becomes too large.

Within Guardian, an **Emergency Re-Speculation Clause** is defined: if, for two consecutive quarters, a significant portion of monitored signals diverges from scenario hypotheses; if a disruptive event changes the playing field; or if core KPIs drop below threshold despite corrective actions, an accelerated four-week cycle is triggered, retracing—in condensed form—the initial phases of the method. The goal is not to redo everything, but to realign the brand to the new landscape without losing its core.

## 4. Measuring Impact — Toward a Hybrid ROI

A speculative method risks being perceived as intangible if it is not linked to measurable results. For this reason, Specula operates from the outset with a measurement framework combining three layers: process, business performance, and systemic impact.

On the process layer, it observes decision velocity, internal alignment quality, reduction of recurring conflicts around brand choices, and the ability to complete complex projects within expected windows. This is not only about “moving faster,” but about reducing organizational energy dispersion.

On the performance layer, metrics vary by sector: in B2C one might track brand consideration shifts, qualitative engagement of communities, and relationship depth rather than mere contact frequency; in B2B, sales cycle length, win rate in complex tenders, and retention of key internal and external roles.

On the systemic impact layer, it introduces indicators measuring coherence between declared futures and enabled transformations: the ability to activate communities around regenerative practices; participation in sector coalitions; contribution to regulatory or cultural changes; and reduction of extractive practices along supply chains. Some of these indicators take years to become meaningful; therefore they are linked to long-term narratives, not only quarterly reporting.

The resulting dashboard is always customized: there is no universal KPI set for all brands. There is a shared grammar for turning preferable futures into observable metrics.

## 5. Engagement Models and Investment Framework

The Specula Method can be engaged at different depths. For each model, duration, team composition, client effort, and investment order of magnitude are clarified.

In the **Specula Audit** format, the focus is diagnostic. In roughly two weeks of actual work (distributed across a mutually agreed calendar), a lean team assesses the brand’s identity state, AI maturity, coherence between declared values and practiced behaviors, and resilience against a few key scenarios. The outcome is a narrative report (not merely an issue list) and a debrief session to decide whether and how to proceed. Investment is calibrated to make this “snapshot” accessible also to mid-sized organizations or internal functions acting as pioneers.

In the **Specula Full Journey** format, the complete process is deployed over roughly two to three months. All phases—scenarios, archaeology, prototyping, Ethical Gate, narrative, co-creation, activation—are carried out with a mixed Specula/client team. Client commitment is substantial: it requires a stable core group with dedicated time and a clear mandate. The result is a suite of documents, prototypes, roadmaps, and policies enabling robust decisions about identity, products, services, and AI systems.

In the **Specula Guardian** format, the work continues on an annual basis. Each quarter, the team pauses to look: how are scenarios moving? Which signals confirm or falsify hypotheses? Where are fragilities, incoherences, and unexpected opportunities emerging? In some cases Guardian stays in the background as an early warning system; in others it becomes the place where deeper realignment moments are prepared and orchestrated, including potential Re-Speculation cycles.

Across formats, the Investment Framework is not just a price list; it is a strategic choice tool. It helps the brand understand whether it mainly needs to see better, redesign itself, or accompany an already-running transformation.

## 6. Selective Openness — The Specula Ethical Framework

For the Specula Method to be credible, it cannot be a black box. Part of the architecture—the ethical layer—is designed to be shareable and, over time, available as an open framework.

This means documenting and publishing (anonymized and generalized) the components structuring the Ethical Gate: key questions, exclusion criteria, types of refused prototypes, and guidelines for distinguishing fertile provocation from normalization of unacceptable practices. It also means providing templates for the Refusal Register and value-coherence checklists that other organizations can use and adapt.

Making this layer open does not weaken the method; it strengthens it. It enables peer comparison, critique, and iterative improvement; makes it harder to use the language of ethics as mere facade; and creates a community of practice that can recognize itself in shared principles even from different worldviews.

What remains proprietary—and continuously updated—are AI systems, prompt configurations, scenario libraries, and internal research/facilitation protocols. This balance between transparency and intellectual property is how Specula can position itself as a credible actor, not another opaque formula.

## 7. Community, Alumni, Validation

The Specula Method does not end with a one-to-one relationship between studio and client. A significant part of its potential lies in connecting brands that go through it—preserving confidentiality of specific content while sharing practices, mistakes, and learning.

The idea of a **Specula Alumni Network** goes in this direction: a space—physical and digital—where brands that completed a Full Journey or are in Guardian can periodically exchange. It is not a club of polished best practices, but a frank forum on what it truly means to hold preferable futures when short-term pressures pull elsewhere.

In parallel, the method includes a program of **structured validation**. In early projects, this means rigorously documenting “before” and “after”: baseline metrics, changed decisions, internal narrative shifts, and expected/unexpected effects. Later, it means engaging academic partners and research centers that can observe effectiveness longitudinally and challenge the method where needed.

Finally, the idea of **Specula Practitioner certification** arises from the need to scale without dilution: those bringing the method into other contexts must have personally gone through training and supervision—not merely read a manual. This creates minimum coherence while leaving space for variants, adaptations, and cross-pollination.

## 8. Operational Priorities for Method Evolution

For Specula, method evolution is not theoretical; it is a living backlog. Some priorities are immediate: producing lighter synthesis materials for commercial use (executive summary, condensed cases, clear engagement narrative), precisely defining the perimeter of Guardian and the Re-Speculation Clause, and making AI governance explicit in every proposal.

Other priorities require months: formalizing the impact measurement framework with early clients, refining Competitive Futures Mapping as a standalone service, piloting the Wild Card Scenario and Refusal Register, and beginning to document results comparably.

Over a longer horizon, the goal is to consolidate the open-source ethical layer, launch the alumni network, activate a first academic partnership, and start the first certified practitioner cohorts. In parallel, the method itself must be subjected to its own Ethical Gate: which parts risk becoming empty rituals? Where might futures rhetoric slip into an aesthetic of complexity without real impact? These questions are part of the work.

---

## 9. Conclusion — The Future as Shared Responsibility

The Specula Method emerges in a context of **permacrisis**, where strategies and identities risk becoming obsolete faster than they can be implemented. Its starting conviction is simple: talking about the future does not mean predicting it, but taking responsibility for orienting the present toward trajectories we consider desirable. In this sense, speculative identity work is not a style exercise; it is a form of care—for the people working in brands, the communities around them, and the ecosystems that sustain them.

Artificial intelligence makes this work more urgent and, if well governed, more powerful. It can help us see what we miss, challenge perceptual habits, and explore possibilities we would not have dared imagine. But it cannot—and must not—replace judgment, conflict, and the slow time required to decide who we want to be.

Specula attempts to hold these layers together: AI’s speculative force, the concreteness of metrics, the firmness of radical values, and the often messy realities in which brands operate. This document is a step in that journey, not its conclusion.

The Ethical Gate does not only protect the brand; it protects the future the brand intends to support by making visible what it chooses not to become. Like any living identity, the method itself must be questioned, updated, tested against real cases, and criticized by those who use it and those who observe it from outside.

If there is one fixed point, it is this: brands are no longer only communication objects. They are actors participating in writing futures. The Specula Method exists to help them do so more consciously, more imaginatively, and more responsibly.
