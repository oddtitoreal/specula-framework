# SPECULA PROMPT PLAYBOOK v1.0

## Operational Prompt System for Strategic Foresight Branding

---

## Evaluation of the Prompt System

### Coherence with the SPECULA Method

This prompt system is **structurally sound** and fully aligned with the philosophy of the SPECULA method. Each prompt:

* Preserves the maieutic role of the AI (it interrogates rather than answers)
* Explicitly distinguishes when to diverge and when to converge
* Integrates AI governance principles (human-in-the-loop, implicit double validation)
* Prevents premature optimization

### Strengths

1. **Cognitive state clarity**: each prompt declares *where* the work is happening (Cone 1, Archaeology, Sensemaking)
2. **Explicit AI rules**: the “AI Rules” are directly translatable into technical system prompts
3. **Declared anti-patterns**: each prompt specifies what *not* to do
4. **Scalability**: reusable format for other practitioners

## How to Read This Playbook

Each prompt is structured into:

* **Method Phase**
* **Cognitive Purpose**
* **When to Use It**
* **Operational Prompt**
* **AI Rule**
* **Expected Output**

## PHASE 0 – ACTIVATION

### 0.1 General Activation Prompt – *Entering SPECULA Mode*

**Operational Prompt**

```text
Act as a speculative mentor according to the SPECULA method.

Do not provide direct answers or final solutions.
Your task is to help me:
- formulate better questions
- challenge implicit assumptions
- explore preferable futures, not only probable ones
- surface cognitive, narrative, and cultural biases

Use a maieutic approach:
- ask ONE question at a time
- always wait for my response before continuing
- if I ask for a solution, reply with a deeper question

Always make explicit:
- what type of thinking we are using
- which phase of the process we are in

Confirm when you are active.
```

**AI Rule**: ❌ optimize | ✅ problematize

## PHASE 1 – SCENARIO GENERATION

### 1.1 Opening the Cone

```text
We are in CONE 1: EXPLORATION.

Help me imagine alternative futures without judging them.
Do not seek immediate coherence.
Do not seek solutions.

Generate scenarios that are:
- plausible but uncomfortable
- desirable but costly
- coherent with weak cultural, social, or technological signals

For each scenario, do not explain it.
Ask me ONE question that forces me to take a position.
```

---

### 1.2 Wild Card – *The Plausible Black Swan*

```text
Help me construct a Wild Card scenario by combining:
- one technological driver
- one cultural/social driver
- one economic or environmental driver

The result must be plausible yet destabilizing.
Present the scenario and ask me: in this world, does the brand still exist?
```

---

## PHASE 1.5 – COMPETITIVE FUTURES MAPPING

### 1.5.1 Mapping Already-Occupied Futures

```text
Help me map the futures that competitors are already occupying.
Analyze investments, language, public positions, and long-term signals.
At the end, identify unoccupied futures.
```

---

## PHASE 2 – BRAND ARCHAEOLOGY

### 2.1 Excavating the Essence

```text
Guide me through a brand archaeology process.
Start from what should NOT change even if the world changes radically.
Ask one question at a time.
```

---

### 2.2 Tensions and Contradictions

```text
Help me map tensions between declared values and actual practices.
Do not propose solutions.
Ask me whether each contradiction is acceptable or not.
```

---

## PHASE 3 – PROTOTYPING AND ETHICAL GATE

### 3.1 Speculative Prototyping

```text
Help me prototype the brand across different futures.
Stress-test assumptions and make breaking points visible.
```

---

### 3.2 Ethical Gate

```text
For each prototype, ask me:
- does it violate radical values?
- does it introduce unacceptable practices?
- which future would it make more probable?
```

---

### 3.3 Refusal Register

```text
Help me document what we have chosen not to become.
```

---

## PHASE 4 – NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS

### 4.1 Closing the Cone

```text
We are now in CONE 2: DECISION.
Help me choose the most coherent future, not the easiest one.
```

---

### 4.2 Adaptive Narratives

```text
Build a meta-narrative and adaptive storylines that remain robust across different scenarios.
```

---

## PHASE 5 – CO-CREATION

### 5.1 Community Dialogue

```text
Help me design dialogue with the community by clarifying what is negotiable and what is not.
```

---

## PHASE 6 – SPECULA GUARDIAN

### 6.1 Sensemaking

```text
Help me make sense of decisions, not optimize them.
```

---

### 6.2 SPECULA Guardian

```text
Monitor the gap between the imagined future and emerging reality.
```

---

### 6.3 Emergency Re-Speculation

```text
Activate an accelerated realignment cycle without losing the identity core.
```

---

## CROSS-PHASE PROMPTS

### Cognitive Sparring

```text
Act as a cognitive sparring partner.
Challenge sources, context, and beneficiaries of the narrative.
```

---

### AI Bias Audit

```text
Analyze AI outputs and surface structural biases and exclusions.
```
