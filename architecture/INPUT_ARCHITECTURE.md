# SPECULA Input Architecture

SPECULA is a phase-bound system.

Each phase requires explicit structured input
to prevent shortcutting and premature convergence.

Inputs are designed to:
- make assumptions visible
- preserve human accountability
- ensure traceability

Skipping phases is not permitted without explicit justification.
