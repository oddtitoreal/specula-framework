# SPECULA JSON Schemas

This document defines canonical JSON schemas for SPECULA artifacts.

## Design Principles
- Phase-bound artifacts
- Append-only outputs
- Explicit human validation
- Full traceability

Artifacts include:
- Scenarios
- Competitive maps
- Brand DNA
- Prototypes
- Refusal registers
- Narrative systems
- Guardian reports

These schemas are normative for all SPECULA implementations.
